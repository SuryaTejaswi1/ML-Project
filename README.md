### A Comprehensive Study of eye-tracking Data in ECG Interpretation

Objective 1: User expertise - performed a multinomial classification to predict the expertise of  various participants in the study
Predicting User Expertise: Utilizing multinomial classification, we aim to accurately identify the expertise level of participants in the study.
We have performed Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting, XG Boosting classification on data before and after sampling with hyperparameter tuning.

Objective 2: What individual characteristics predict whether a participant will revisit a grid-based AOI?
Unveiling Revisiting Factors: We explore what individual characteristics predict whether a participant will revisit a specific grid-based AOI.

Objective 3: Use a regression model to predict the time spent on each AOI (Time_spent_G) based on the practitioner's group (Group) and other features. This will quantify the influence of practitioner role on attention allocation to specific AOIs.
Quantifying Practitioner Role Influence: Employing a regression model, we strive to quantify the influence of practitioner role on the time spent on each AOI (Time_spent_G) based on group affiliation and other relevant features.
